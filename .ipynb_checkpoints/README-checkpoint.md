# Spam-Comment-Detection
Detecting spam comments is the task of text classification in Machine Learning. Spam comments on social media platforms are the type of comments posted to redirect the user to another social media account, website or any piece of content.

To detect spam comments with Machine Learning, we need labelled data of spam comments. Luckily, I found a dataset on Kaggle about YouTube spam comments which will be helpful for the task of spam comments detection. You can download the dataset from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/images).


## Naive Bayes Algorithm
This project uses a dataset of YouTube comments to train a machine learning model that can classify comments as spam or not spam. The Bernoulli Naive Bayes algorithm is used for this binary classification task.

## Results
The model achieves an accuracy score of approximately 91.32% on the test data.
